Battle Isle 2020

## Description
Battle Isle 2020 is a Windows port of Battle Isle 2 and 3 which are a 1994 strategy game from German video game developer Blue Byte (now Ubisoft). BI2020 has been coded in PowerBasic from scratch; without knowledge of the original BlueByte source code. This means BI2020 does not exactly behave like the original games but tries to behave as close as possible.

## Getting started
### System requirements
- Microsoft Windows XP/2003/Vista/Win7/Win8/Win10
- Microsoft DirectX 9.0c
- ca 150 MB free disk space
- PowerBasic Console Compiler - PBCC 6.0

If you just want to play the game without compiling it first, you can download the latest executable from: 
https://www.kitana.org/bi2020

## Installation of Battle Isle 2020
1. Extract the content of the ZIP file to any folder. This folder becomes the application folder of Battle Isle 2020.
2. Make sure you have Battle Isle 2 and/or Battle Isle 3 installed on your computer (or your BI2/BI3 CDs ready) because BI2020 uses the graphics, sounds, and data from these games.
3. Run BI2020.EXE
